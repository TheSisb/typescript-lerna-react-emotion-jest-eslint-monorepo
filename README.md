## Objective

The goal of this repo is to figure out a good structure for a monorepo using:
- yarn workspaces
- lerna
- conventional commits + semver releases
- typescript + babel-preset-typescript
- EmotionJS + Styled System
- React
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Jest + Snapshot testing
- Storybook

With clear build commands.


## Issues

`yarn build:types` fails.
